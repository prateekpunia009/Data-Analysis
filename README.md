# Residential Energy Appliance Classification

Electricity consumption in residential sectors accounts for more than 20% of total
consumption, and thus energy-saving technology for residential buildings is of vital importance.
Choosing the right time to consume the right amount of electricity will increase energy efficiency
and reduce emissions.

Load monitoring (also known as load detection and load disaggregation) is a promising technique to provide detailed electricity consumption information and usage of individual appliances in
residential buildings.
